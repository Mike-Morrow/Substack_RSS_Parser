              "<p>I&#8217;m launching a project called <em><a href=\"https://bettergutdigest.com\">Better Gut Digest</a>. </em>I initially wanted to host my website with Substack, but I need more flexibility and control, so I decided to DIY. I considered Wordpress and Ghost &#8212; both the paid/managed versions and the roll-your-own options, but I ultimately landed on using a static site generator because I wanted something simple and low cost. </p><p>As the name suggests, static site generators are software tools designed to generate static html sites. In order to get a blog running with an SSG, the developer needs to provide the following:</p><ul><li><p>HTML templates: these define the look and feel of your webpages </p></li><li><p>Data files: these files spell out global variables that you can refernce in your HTML templates via a templating language (e.g. {{ title }} will insert the blog&#8217;s title into an HTML template)</p></li><li><p>Configuration files: defines how your static site generator actually builds your site (i.e. generates your production-ready HTML outputs)</p></li><li><p>Markdown posts: these are the actual blog posts</p></li><li><p>Static assets: these are the files for images or other media used in the blog posts or other parts of the website</p></li></ul><h3>Functional Diagram of how SSG works</h3><div class=\"captioned-image-container\"><figure><a class=\"image-link image2 is-viewable-imag\" href=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F002cec62-f4e3-4356-8b6d-e3caf283fbc0_2200x1124.png\" target=\"_blank\"><div class=\"image2-inset\"><source type=\"image/webp\" /><img alt=\"\" class=\"sizing-normal\" height=\"744\" src=\"https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/w_1456,c_limit,f_auto,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2F002cec62-f4e3-4356-8b6d-e3caf283fbc0_2200x1124.png\" width=\"1456\" /><div class=\"image-link-expand\"><svg class=\"lucide lucide-maximize2 \" fill=\"none\" height=\"20\" stroke=\"currentColor\" stroke-linecap=\"round\" stroke-linejoin=\"round\" stroke-width=\"2\" viewBox=\"0 0 24 24\" width=\"20\" xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\"><polyline points=\"15 3 21 3 21 9\"></polyline><polyline points=\"9 21 3 21 3 15\"></polyline><line x1=\"21\" x2=\"14\" y1=\"3\" y2=\"10\"></line><line x1=\"3\" x2=\"10\" y1=\"21\" y2=\"14\"></line></svg></div></div></a></figure></div><div><hr /></div><p>So far I&#8217;ve tried out Jekyll, Hugo, and Eleventy. I&#8217;ve deployed them both locally and to Netlify. I&#8217;ve tried attaching a CMS. I&#8217;ve tried building from a template vs coding from scratch. My takeaway from all of this: even the simplest setups are more complex that I thought. </p><p>I may change my mind, but I think I&#8217;m going to go with Eleventy and I&#8217;m going to code it from scratch in the beginning to get a feel for how it works &#8212; then I&#8217;ll probably switch to an out-of-the-box template that looks better than what I can make. I&#8217;ll deploy the site to Netlify (which is so much simpler for me than deploying directly on AWS or GCP which is what I&#8217;ve done for previous projects like LatLongExcel.com, Whatinmyfridge.ai, and Groceryplaylist.com). I also will import the project to Netlify from Github so that any time I push a change to Github, my site will be rebuilt and redeployed. </p><p>Going through this setup of making a DIY blog has been harder than I thought, but it&#8217;s been a great learning experience. And it&#8217;s going to be lower cost and more flexible. And if I do a good job, I&#8217;ll also manage to keep it low maintenance and easy for someone to pick up if I no longer become directly involved in the management of it. </p><p></p><p>update (9/21/24): I ended up going with <a href=\"https://github.com/surjithctly/neat-starter\">this Eleventy theme (neat-starter)</a> &#8212; it has a one-click deploy to Netlify option and is preconfigured with a CMS. This basically ticked all my boxes while still being simple and easy to navigate. </p>"
